# Changelog

## 1.0.0 (UNRELEASED)

- Breaking Change: Never modify Location headers that are only paths without hosts. [John Bachir](https://github.com/jjb) [#46](https://github.com/waterlink/rack-reverse-proxy/pull/46)
- Breaking Change: Previously, the Accept-Encoding header was stripped by default, unless the
  `preserve_encoding` option was set to true. Now, no headers are stripped by default, and an array
  of headers that should be stripped can be specified with the `stripped_headers` option. [John Bachir](https://github.com/jjb) [#52](https://github.com/waterlink/rack-reverse-proxy/pull/52)
- Breaking Change: Previously, rack-reverse-proxy had the behavior/bug that when reverse_proxy_options
  was invoked, all options that weren't set in the invokation would be set to nil. Now, those options will remain set at their default values - [Krzysztof Knapik](https://github.com/knapo) [#37](https://github.com/waterlink/rack-reverse-proxy/pull/37) and [John Bachir](https://github.com/jjb) [#47](https://github.com/waterlink/rack-reverse-proxy/pull/47)
- Breaking Change: Previously, when invoking reverse_proxy_options multiple times, only the
  final invocation would have any effect. Now, the invocations will have a commulative effect.
  [John Bachir](https://github.com/jjb) [#47](https://github.com/waterlink/rack-reverse-proxy/pull/47)
- Bugfix: Fix rack response body for https redirects [John Bachir](https://github.com/jjb) [#43](https://github.com/waterlink/rack-reverse-proxy/pull/43)
