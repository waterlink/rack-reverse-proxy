# A Reverse Proxy for Rack
[![TravisCI](https://secure.travis-ci.org/waterlink/rack-reverse-proxy.svg "Build Status")](http://travis-ci.org/waterlink/rack-reverse-proxy "Build Status")

This is a simple reverse proxy for Rack that pretty heavily rips off Rack Forwarder. It is not meant for production systems (although it may work), as the webserver fronting your app is generally much better at this sort of thing.

## Installation
The gem is available on rubygems.  Assuming you have a recent version of Rubygems you should just be able to install it via:

```
gem install rack-reverse-proxy
```

For your Gemfile use:

```ruby
gem "rack-reverse-proxy", require: "rack/reverse_proxy"
```

## Usage

`Rack::ReverseProxy` should ideally be the very first middleware in your
stack. In a typical use case it is being used to proxy an entirely
different website through your application, so it's unlikely that you will want
any other middleware to modify the requests or responses. The examples below
reflect this.


### Generic Rack app example

```ruby
require 'rack/reverse_proxy'

use Rack::ReverseProxy do
  # Set :preserve_host to true globally (default is true already)
  reverse_proxy_options preserve_host: true

  # Forward the path /test* to http://example.com/test*
  reverse_proxy '/test', 'http://example.com/'

  # Forward the path /foo/* to http://example.com/bar/*
  reverse_proxy /^\/foo(\/.*)$/, 'http://example.com/bar$1', username: 'name', password: 'basic_auth_secret'
end

app = proc do |env|
  [ 200, {'Content-Type' => 'text/plain'}, ["b"] ]
end
run app
```

### Ruby on Rails app example

This example use `config.middleware.insert(0` to ensure that
`Rack::ReverseProxy` is first in the stack. It is possible that
other code in your app (usually in application.rb, development.rb, or production.rb)
will take over this position in the stack. To ensure
that this is not the case, view the stack by running `rails middleware`. You should see
`Rack::ReverseProxy` at the top. Note that
the middleware stack will likely differ slightly in each environment. All that said, it's a pretty
safe bet to put the below code into application.rb.

```ruby
# config/application.rb
config.middleware.insert(0, Rack::ReverseProxy) do
  reverse_proxy_options preserve_host: true
  reverse_proxy '/wiki', 'http://wiki.example.com/'
end
```

### Rules

As seen in the Rack example above, `reverse_proxy` can be invoked multiple times with
different rules, which will be commulatively added.

Rules can be a regex or a string. If a regex is used, you can use the subcaptures in your forwarding url by denoting them with a `$`.

Right now if more than one rule matches any given route, it throws an exception for an ambiguous match.  This will probably change later. If no match is found, the call is forwarded to your application.


### Options

#### Terminology

<dl>
  <dt>Source Request</dt>
  <dd>The request sent from the end user's browser to the rack stack which is running rack-reverse-proxy.</dd>
  <dt>Target Request</dt>
  <dd>The request sent from rack-reverse-proxy to the server which will produce the response.</dd>
</dl>

`reverse_proxy_options` sets global options for all reverse proxies. Available options are:

* `:preserve_host` This determines which Host header is used in the target request. If set to `true`, the target
  request's host (specified in the `reverse_proxy` invocation) will be used. If set to `false`, the source request's
  Host header will be re-used for the target request. Default: `true`.
* `:username` username for basic auth
* `:password` password for basic auth
* `:matching` is a global only option, if set to :first the first matched url will be requested (no ambigous error). Default: :all.
* `:timeout` seconds to timout the requests
* `:force_ssl` redirects to ssl version, if not already using it (requires `:replace_response_host`). Default: false.
* `:verify_mode` the `OpenSSL::SSL` verify mode passed to Net::HTTP. Default: `OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER`.
* `:x_forwarded_headers` sets up proper `X-Forwarded-*` headers. Default: true.
* `:stripped_headers` Array of headers that should be stripped before forwarding reqeust. Default: nil.
  e.g. `stripped_headers: ["Accept-Encoding", "Foo-Bar"]`

If `reverse_proxy_options` is invoked multiple times, the invocations will have a commulative effect,
only overwritting the values which they specify. Example of how this could be useful:

```ruby
config.middleware.insert(0, Rack::ReverseProxy) do
  reverse_proxy_options preserve_host: false
  if Rails.env.production? or Rails.env.staging?
    reverse_proxy_options force_ssl: true, replace_response_host: true
  end
  reverse_proxy /^\/blog(\/?.*)$/, 'http://blog.example.com/blog$1'
end
```

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
